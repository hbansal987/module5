## Conclusion

Great job! In this module we started working on game mechanics, starting with the player movement and camera movement. Moving on we will keep working on more game mechanics such as NPC (Non-Player Character) movement, character customization and more! 

You can keep adding more to the design of the game world on your own, using what you have learned so far.
